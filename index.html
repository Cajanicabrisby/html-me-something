      <title>Manifesting the Life I Deserve</title>
      <h1>The Universe</h1>
      <p>Our life is ultimately what we make it. We can sit around and do nothing and blame the Universe for the things that go wrong in it or we can manifest the things we want by being optimistic with our thoughts and putting them into the Universe. Changing your thought process will ultimately change your life! I live proof of it!!!</p>

               <h2>How it all began</h2>
               <p>Before having children I will admit I lived a free life without a care in the world. This was actually dangerous because I literally had no care in the world, not for myself or future. Being told I may not ever have kids being dignosed with stage 3 endometriosis played a huge part. I was hurt maybe even depressed and not realizing it. Fast forward at the age of 25 I had my first child and he changed my life and I sat myself down ...a little. His dad was going to be going to jail so I knew i had to change something more. I have always wanted to be a lawyer so my bestfriend encouraged me to enroll back in school. She changed my life because in that same conversation she drove me to enroll. I am glad because I am a procrastinator.</p>

               <h3>School, Work and Parenting</h3>
               <p> Returning back to school was not all that easy. I was getting use to being a parent , returning to work and school full time. I had a lot of help so I still was a little distracted because I still wanted to have fun. I found myself getting unfocused which caused me to fail a couple classes. I knew this was not what I wanted but I did not know what to do and I began to battle with depression. I prayed for guidance and I got pregant with my daugther. I'll tell you what lol i ai nt know what type of guidance the Universe and God sent me but I was bout to find out becasue I did not feel i was ready for another kid. Fast forward she admires me so much that I knew I had to be the best role model for and I began to become more motivated. I knew my kids were watching and I had so much to show them to help mold them to be amazing so I had to stop destructing myself. I had been laid off for a  year from Citi Bank and no one wanted to hire a person who was pregnant. Gods Grace and Mercy kept me from suffering.</p>

               <h4>Manifesting</h4>
               <p>After the birth of my daughter, I had a reality check. I knew i had to make a plan for muyself and i had been hearing a lot about manifesting and speaking things into existence. I already prayed about so much in my life so I knew I would be ok but i wanted to try Manifesting things for myslef outside of prayer. I never wanted to have to always just run to God when i was in a bind so I started praying for the strength to manifest things and I began to find myself thanking God for just Strength. The strength to do everything my heart desired. I have always wanted to work for Centene and suprisingly they were building a building near my home in Ferguson, Missouri. I told myslef you are going to get in that building and then its up from there. I filled out over 10 applications and to my suprised I was selected to interview for a position AT THE FERGUSON LOCATION !!! Fast forward I interviewed and was hired. Once within the company I made the decision to myself that I wanted to move up the ladder fast. So I focused and within the second month I was uptrained to process special claims, a month from that promoted to an advanced analyst and a Mentor for training classes. I was beginning to be noticed by a lot of important people. Within a year I was promoted to team lead. I was super excited! School was going good , Parenting was great and i realized that every goal I made for myself came to fruition!!!! I manifested everything. Excited would do my feelings no justice. But we all know that with leveling up comes downfalls. Things were goinf so great, income and school wise i found myslef falling back into my partying ways. I was masking my depression with alcohol and partying. Although I had everything I wanted financial wise and school wise and I was being a great mother, I still was missing something. Something I had the time for. Loving on myself! Oh and I forgot to mention, the reckless behavior got me pregnant with now a third child./p>

               <h5>The bandemic ... Yes BAND</h5>
               <p>Being pregant with my third child took a toll on me and although I am pro choice something in me would not let me terminate a pregnancy. I mean my finances was finally at a good point and although my children has a fathers my mentality never let me base my life off of the help of them. So there I go again at a crossroads. I took a year off from school because I needed to really focus because although I felt i could not keep bringing children into this world while im trying to figure myself out I realize these kids were the blessing and understand I kept asking God for. I prayed to and I knew God would not put more on me than i could bare becasue he has been making a way for me all this time. So, I prayed and I put me and my children and my unborns life and the hands of the lord and I spoke to the Universe on a regular. Then the Pandemic hit. The world stopped! At this moment i realized I had all of the time in the world to figure things out. I began to save money, I began to interact more with my kids considering having to work from home and homeschooling. I began to face my demons. made time for journaling even cry (because believe it or not, crying helps) But overall, I began to rebuild myself. Giving birth during the pandemic let me know how much I can accomplish alone if I made myself focus. Althought the pandemic made me sit down and focus i knew it could be done so I had to apply this to my everyday life . I did just that. I battled a litt post partum but one day I woke up and said "This has to stop and it has to stop now"! I was back at work and tired of the position, I wanted more for myself and I deserved more for myself so I was goinf to get more for myself. I had heard about the Coder Girl program from a family member and she told my how she was working now for the very company I work for making close to 6 figures being a Scrum Master. I said "Well Damn" I thought coding was so attractive in a woman because its predominantly men just like the legal field. Then I told myself "Channel all that energy into being GREAT and do BOTH!" I signed up for the program and had wait but when the opportunity came I enrolled and was excepted. I didnt know how I was going to do it but I wanted to and I was going to make it happen! Fast Forward I am doing it and my kids see it so I push myself even more. My son loves video games, he sees me talk about tech so much now he asked "Mom can you make an app when you finish learning code? If so I want you to teach me because I want to be able to make video games and Apps" I cried because the fight I put up to save my life is paying off. You can have all the success and money in the world but what does it mean if you don't instill it in the youth that they can do it to. The Youth just happens to be my own children</p>
